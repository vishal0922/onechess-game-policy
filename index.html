        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 20, 2026</p>
        <p><strong>OneChess Game</strong> is built as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by <strong>EchoFrnd Developer</strong> at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
        <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this
            policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will
            not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information (Anonymous Identifiers). The information that we request will be retained on our
            device and is not collected by us in any way personally.</p>
        <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong></li>
            <li><strong>AdMob</strong> (Advertising IDs for personalized ads)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> (Anonymous UID for multiplayer sessions)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> (Temporary game state data)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> (Crash reporting and stability data)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h2>2. Account Deletion Policy</h2>
            <p>In accordance with Google Play's Data Deletion policy, we provide clear options for users to manage their
                data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Accounts:</strong> Our app uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication. This creates a
                    technical identifier (UID) rather than a personal account. Since no personal emails or phone numbers
                    are linked, there is no persistent "identity".</li>
                <li><strong>How to Delete:</strong> You can request deletion of any session data associated with your
                    Anonymous UID directly within the app's settings or by clearing the app data in your device
                    settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Deletion:</strong> All online game room data is automatically deleted from our
                    servers immediately after a match concludes or when players disconnect.</li>
                <li><strong>Web-based Request:</strong> If you wish to request manual deletion of any data associated
                    with your technical UID, please contact us at the email provided below.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>3. Log Data</h2>
        <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app we collect data and
            information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
            information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
            configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
            statistics.</p>
        <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These
            are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
            libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.</p>
        <h2>5. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with
            personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.</p>
